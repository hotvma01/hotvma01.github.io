		<p><h2>This is me last year in Colorado.</h2></p>
		<p>My name is Matt. I enjoy many things, including video games, dicking around on the web, trying (and failing) to be funny, and other stuff, I guess.</p>
		
		<button onclick="RevealBlog();">Click for my asinine blog. It's pretty boring, though.</button>
			
       				<p id="Blog"></p>
       				
      				<script>
       				function RevealBlog() {

		<p>I'm currently trying to wake myself up in the morining to go running in the mornings, but so far I have been unsucsessful. I think this may be because I currently don't have a running partner. This is a problem. Geoff is supposed to run with me on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but so far he has ducked out, which demotivates me. Another problem I have with running in the morning it that I have trouble falling asleep at 11:30, which leads me to be tired in the morning at 7:30, when I set my alarm to wake up so I can go running. So, you know. It sucks.</p>
