		<p><h2>This is me last year in Colorado. My name is Matt. I enjoy many things, including video games, dicking around on the web, trying (and failing) to be funny, and other stuff, I guess.</h2></p>
		<p>If I could, I would sleep all day and stay up all night. But then I couldn't attend classes, so there's that.</p>
		<p>I'm currently trying to wake myself up in the morining to go running in the mornings, but so far I have been unsucsessful. I think this may be because I currently don't have a running partner. This is a problem. Geoff is supposed to run with me on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but so far he has ducked out, which demotivates me. Another problem I have with running in the morning it that I have trouble falling asleep at 11:30, which leads me to be tired in the morning at 7:30, when I set my alarm to wake up so I can go running. So, you know. It sucks.</p>
		<h4>These are the things I like to do on a daily basis.</h4>

		<dl>
			<dt><p><h3>1. Sleep</h3></p></dt>
				<dd>This involves closing my eyes and becoming unconscious in a controlled environment for hours on end.</dd>
			<dt><p><h3>2. Eat</h3></p></dt>
				<dd>This involves putting food into my mouth, usually chewing it, and the swallowing. The food is then digested by the acids in my stomach and nutrients are absorbed into my body from the food.</dd>
			<dt><p><h3>3. Be Sociable</h3></p></dt>
				<dd>This involves leaving my room to enter the Brandt Social Lounge, where people that I identify with and have relationships with sometimes meet to share each other's company. These people, also known as friends, often talk, watch visual media, and eat together. Truly the hallmarks of true friendship.
