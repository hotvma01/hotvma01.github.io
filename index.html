		<h2>These are the things I like to do on a daily basis.</h2>

		<dl>
			<dt><p>1. Sleep</p></dt>
				<dd>This involves closing my eyes and becoming unconscious in a controlled environment for hours on end.</dd>
			<dt><p>2. Eat</p></dt>
				<dd>This involves putting food into my mouth, usually chewing it, and the swallowing. The food is then digested by the acids in my stomach and nutrients are absorbed into my body from the food.</dd>
			<dt><p>3. Be Sociable</p></dt>
				<dd>This involves leaving my room to enter the Brandt Social Lounge, where people that I identify with and have relationships with sometimes meet to share each other's company. These people, also known as friends, often talk, watch visual media, and eat together. Truly the hallmarks of true friendship.
